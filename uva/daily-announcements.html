## Midterm procedure
- This is the procedure for both midterms this semester
- It is taken during your normal lab section
- The first rule of 2150 midterm is that you don't speak about 2150 midterm
  - Translation: it is an honor violation to speak about it to somebody who has not taken it yet
- You have to fill out the bubble footer at the bottom of the first page of the exam
  - And put your name and UVa userid at the top of each page
  - And sign the honor pledge
- We hope to have it graded later that week (Thursday evening is our grading party)
- There will not be office hours the Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of a midterm week
- No lab this week due to this.
- No lab next week due to fall break.
- Many questions will have a "word limit"...
