  - Unfortunately, I don't directly control that account.
  - We expect you to have this sorted out by next Tuesday's lab. 
- Several lab machines did not have clang++ installed. System staff looked into this and we think has it resolved now.
- Don't have access to the course tools? Email me and I'll add you (Think I got most of you added yesterday, but might be a couple stragglers still). If you just added the course, you will likely need this.
- Course capacity / Lab capacity was increased on Monday.
- [Lab 1](../labs/lab01/index.html) and [Tutorial 1](../tutorials/01-intro-unix/index.html) are happening now. Pre-lab due by tomorrow morning.
